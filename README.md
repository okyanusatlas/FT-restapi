Requirements: NodeJS, Postman

For testing the endpoints:

1) Clone the repo
2) run npm install
3) npm start (server runs on port 7777)
4) Import FT.postman_collection.json to your own postman

Due to time limitation, couldn't "beautify" the code well ( e.g there are some code duplications ), 
and a few small issues (e.g: to be able to develop it fast, always took id: array.length while adding new item,
which is not a good practice)
